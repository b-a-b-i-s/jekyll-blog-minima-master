# jekyll-blog-minima-master

This is an extension to [b-a-b-i-s/jekyll-blog](https://github.com/b-a-b-i-s) which uses the master branch of minima theme at the time of writing. Specifically the commit [296bf6b872b8450529bee1e48d0ca9be200a4be5](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/296bf6b872b8450529bee1e48d0ca9be200a4be5) was used. I used the master branch version because social buttons looked a lot better than minima 2.5.1. You can see the old version on [b-a-b-i-s.github.io/jekyll-blog/](https://b-a-b-i-s.github.io/jekyll-blog/) and the new on [b-a-b-i-s.github.io/jekyll-blog-minima-master/](https://b-a-b-i-s.github.io/jekyll-blog-minima-master/).
